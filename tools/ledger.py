"""The ledger — this factory's state surface, and its ONLY writer.

State that lives only in chat is not state; it is a memory of a conversation.
This tool is the single append path for `evidence/ledger.jsonl`, so the file has
one writer by construction rather than by good intentions.

Why a tool and not "append with an editor": two lanes appending at once both
read the same last row, both write `n+1`, and the ledger silently acquires two
row 41s. The rubric's Single-writer state criterion (L3) counts a *named*
authoritative writer per surface — this is that name.

Commands
--------
  append --event E --actor A --subject S --detail D   the only write
  tail [--n N]                                        read-only, newest last
  verify                                              read-only: structure, and
                                                      each subject's sequence

Exit: 0 ok, 1 problem (bad usage, corrupted ledger, unknown event type, or a
close whose transition sequence is incomplete).

Row shape (one JSON object per line, append-only):
  {"n":1,"ts":"...","event":"claim","actor":"triage","subject":"#6","detail":"..."}

The transition sequence
-----------------------
A subject's rows are a sequence, not a row count: `intake` (filed), then
`claim` (taken), then `close` (finished). A close with no intake is work that
was never filed; a close with no claim is work nobody took. `verify` reads the
sequence and names the subject and the missing leg.
